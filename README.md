# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis 

## Overview 
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company using Python. The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and is related to telecom customer behaviour. Customer churn is a critical business metric, and understanding the factors contributing to it is essential for any telecommunications company. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a predictive model to identify potential churners.

## Data 
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics 

## Ensemble Learning and Random Forests 
In this project, ensemble learning techniques are applied - specifically the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, for the predictive modelling phase. Ensemble learning is a machine learning method that combines the predictions of multiple models (learners) to improve the overall performance. The RF algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions to make more accurate and robust predictions. 

RFs offer many advantages in the context of customer churn prediction: 

- **High Accuracy**: They are known for their high prediction accuracy, making them suitable for complex classification tasks like identifying customer churn.
- **Reduced Overfitting**: RFs reduce overfitting, a common issue in decision trees, by combining the results of multiple trees.
- **Feature Importance**: They provide a measure of feature importance, allowing us to understand which factors contribute most to customer churn.
- **Robustness**: One the main reasons this algorithm was chosen for this project is because it is robust to noisy data and outliers. 


## Dependencies 
To run this project and reproduce the analysis, you will need to have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas

You can install these packages using pip or conda, and you may use a Jupyter notebook or your preferred Python IDE for the analysis.


## Usage 
If you wish to explore this project further, you can clone this GitHub repository to your local machine. Make sure to have the required Python packages installed as mentioned in the 'Dependencies' section. You can then run the provided Python scripts to analyze and visualize the telecom customer churn data. The project includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading: The telecom customer churn dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. Data Profiling: A data profile report is generated to understand the dataset's basic statistics, data types, and initial insights.
3. Data Visualization: The project includes visualizations to explore the distribution of the target variable ('Customer Status') and correlations between numerical features.
4. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is prepared for machine learning, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
5. Model Building: A random forest classifier is trained to predict customer churn.
6. Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are presented to assess its performance.

Please refer to the relevant scripts and documents within the repository for a complete analysis and detailed code implementation.


## Disclaimer 
The analysis and visualizations in this project were conducted using the available data sources. While the code and analysis are provided for educational and portfolio purposes, it is essential to ensure the accuracy and suitability of the analysis for any real-world application. Real-world applications may require additional considerations and domain-specific knowledge.
